let's say you wanna grab information from API whit 'A' e pass to 'B', XCOM function like a box that stores that information in the metadata database so 'B' can pull.

So how can task B knows which XCOM has his information? XCOM is identified in many ways, one off them is the **key**: it has always a key and it don't need to be unique because XCOM has more ways to be called. 

In addition to the key you have the **DAG id** and the **Task id** where the XCOM was created.
Can be use to identify the XCOM also the **run ID** (important say that he `run_id` is automatically generated by Airflow based on the **`logical_date`,** in this case, the `logical_date` is the primary key and the `run_id` simply reflects it. ). Most of the time you will only identify the key and Task ID.

 To share it out between your tasks you will use the XCOM mechanism. Basically, you push the value from the task and that creates a XCOM with the value that you want to share in it.

### Using 
```python
from airflow.sdk import dag, task, Context

@dag
def xcom_dag():
	@task
	def task_a(**context: Context):
		val = 42
		context['ti'].xcom_push(key='my_key', value=val)
		
	@task
	def task_b(**context: Context:)
		val = context['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='task_a', key='my_key')
		
		print(val)
	task_a() >> task_b()
	
xcom_dag()
```

easier way
```python
@dag
def xcom_dag():
	
	@task
	def task_a():
		val = 42
		return val
		
	@task
	def task_b(val: int):
		print(val)
		
	val = task_a()
	task_b(val)
	
xcom_dag()	
```

another way:
```python
@dag
def xcom_dag():
	
	@task
	def task_a(ti):
		val = 42
		ti.xcom_push(key='my_key', value=val)
		
	@task
	def task_b(ti):
		ti.xcom_pull(task_id="task_a", key='my_key')
		
	val = task_a()
	task_b(val)
	
xcom_dag()	
```

multiple variables in multiple tasks:
```python
@dag
def xcom_dag():
	
	@task
	def task_a(ti):
		val = 42
		ti.xcom_push(key='my_key', value=val)
		
	@task
	def task_c(ti):
		val = 46
		ti.xcom_push(key='my_key', value=val)	
		
	@task
	def task_b(ti):
		vals = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids=["task_a","task_c"], key="my_key")
		print(vals)
		
	task_a() >> task_c() >>	task_b()
	
xcom_dag()
```

multiple variables in one task:
```python
@dag
def xcom_dag():
	
	@task
	def task_a(ti):
		val = {
			"val_1": 42,
			"val_2": 46,
		}
		ti.xcom_push(key='my_key', value=val)
		
	@task
	def task_b(ti):
		vals = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids="task_a", key="my_key")
		print(vals)
		
	task_a() >>	task_b()
	
xcom_dag()
```

## limitations

When transfer data between tasks, pushing and pulling from de metadata metabase, the database you use will influence the amout of data that you can share using XCOM.

SQLite is 2Gb per XCOM
Postgres is 1Gb
MySQL is 64MB

## Questions

Question 1: 
Select the 4 factors that define the uniqueness of an XCOM

 ==key==

 value

 timestamp

 ==dag_id==

 ==task_id==

 ==logical_date==
______

Question 2:  
Is it possible to push an XCOM without explicitly specifying a key?

 ==Yes==

 No
 _____
 
Question 3: 
An XCOM is pushed into..

 The scheduler

 The worker

 The webserver

 ==The database==
___

Question 4:  
With Postgres, can you share 2Gb of data between 2 tasks with an XCOM?

 Yes

 ==No==
____

Question 5:  
How the Scheduler knows which XCOM to choose for a given DAGRun when multiple XCOMs have the same key, dag_id, and task_id?

 It selects one XCOM randomly

 ==It selects the XCOM based on the logical date==

 You can't have multiple XCOMs with the same key, dag_id and task_id
